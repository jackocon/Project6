# Project6

Swapped out images and added animation to nav items. Checked HTML for
errors and the only remaining are duplicate IDs. Checked CSS for errors
and the only remaining are fill errors. Cross checked 4 separate
browsers and resolved issues.

Only known browser issue that persists is in IE and Edge. At a narrow viewport it 
refuses to be responsive and creates scroll room on the x-axis.

One issue I ran into was the similiar class name of st1 created an issue with the media query trying to hide all st1 classes. I had to
rename the st1 class in the nav svg so that only it would be targeted by that css change.
